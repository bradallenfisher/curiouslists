A **digital lease** is an electronic agreement between a landlord and tenant that outlines the terms and conditions of a rental property. Unlike traditional paper leases, digital leases are created, signed, stored, and managed entirely online using specialized software or platforms.

- **Cloud storage:** All lease documents are securely stored online, making access and retrieval faster and more convenient.
- **Automated reminders:** Digital lease platforms often include automated notifications for lease renewals, rent payments, and important deadlines.
- **Interactive forms:** Some digital leases incorporate dynamic forms and fields that update information in real time.
- **Compliance and security:** Advanced encryption and compliance with legal standards ensure that digital leases are both secure and legally binding.
