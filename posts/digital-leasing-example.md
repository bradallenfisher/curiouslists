Digital leasing is transforming the way businesses and consumers handle rental agreements, by enabling fully online lease management—streamlining the process and reducing paperwork. But what does a **digital leasing example** look like in practice?

## What is Digital Leasing?

Digital leasing refers to the process of managing lease agreements through online platforms, eliminating the need for physical documents, in-person meetings, and manual signatures. It leverages technology such as **electronic signatures (e-signatures)**, **cloud storage**, and **automated workflows** to make leasing fast, transparent, and accessible.

## Example of Digital Leasing

Imagine you want to rent an apartment. Instead of visiting a leasing office, filling out paper applications, and signing a lease in person, you can:

1. **Browse Available Properties Online** – Using a website or mobile app.
2. **Submit Rental Application Digitally** – Uploading necessary documents like ID and proof of income.
3. **Sign the Lease Agreement Electronically** – Using secure e-signature platforms compliant with legal standards.
4. **Make Payments Online** – Including deposits, rent, and fees.
5. **Manage the Lease Through a Portal** – Tracking payments, submitting maintenance requests, and communicating with landlords.

Platforms such as **AppFolio**, **RentCafe**, and **LeaseRunner** facilitate this end-to-end digital leasing experience.

## Benefits Highlighted by the Example

- **Convenience:** Tenants and landlords save time by avoiding in-person processes.
- **Speed:** Lease approvals and signing can happen within minutes or hours instead of days.
- **Security:** Digital records reduce errors and provide better long-term access.
