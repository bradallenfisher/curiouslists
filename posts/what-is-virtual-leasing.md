Virtual leasing is a modern approach to leasing properties that leverages digital technology to streamline and simplify the rental process. Instead of traditional in-person visits and paperwork, virtual leasing allows potential tenants and landlords to complete leasing activities online, often without needing to meet physically.

Virtual leasing typically involves several important features:

- **Digital Applications and Screening:** Rental applications, background checks, and credit screening are completed electronically, speeding up approvals.
- **Electronic Lease Signing:** Legal documentation is signed digitally using e-signature platforms, eliminating the need for printing and mailing paper copies.
