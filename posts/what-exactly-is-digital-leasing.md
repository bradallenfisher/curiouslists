Digital leasing is a modern approach to the traditional leasing process that leverages technology to streamline and simplify how leases are created, signed, managed, and renewed. It primarily applies to rental agreements across various sectors such as real estate, automotive, and equipment rentals, enabling both landlords and tenants to conduct lease-related activities entirely online.

Prospective tenants can apply for a lease through digital platforms where background checks, credit screenings, and document submissions happen seamlessly without physical paperwork.
