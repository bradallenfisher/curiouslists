The **digital leasing model** is transforming the way businesses and individuals access and utilize digital assets, such as software, digital properties, and online services. Unlike traditional ownership, digital leasing allows users to temporarily rent or lease digital products, providing flexibility and lowering upfront costs.

## Key Components of the Digital Leasing Model

1. **Leasing Digital Assets**  
   Assets like domain names, websites, software licenses, or digital advertising space can be leased. The owner retains control over the asset, while the lessee gains access and usage rights for a predefined **period**.

2. **Subscription or Fixed-Term Agreements**  
   Most digital leases operate on **subscription** models, where payments recur over a period (monthly, quarterly, annually), or fixed-term contracts with clearly defined start and end dates.

3. **Access and Usage Rights**  
   Instead of ownership transfer, leasing provides **access** and **usage rights** subject to terms outlined in the lease agreement, including limitations on modifications, redistribution, or commercial exploitation.

4. **Maintenance and Support**  
   Often, owners provide ongoing **maintenance, updates, and support** during the lease period, enhancing value and ensuring the asset remains functional and up-to-date.

5. **Renewal and Termination Options**  
   Leases typically include options to renew or terminate the agreement once the period ends, giving lessees flexibility to continue, upgrade, or relinquish the digital asset.

## Benefits of Digital Leasing

- **Cost-Effective Access:** Lower initial costs compared to full ownership.
- **Flexibility:** Ability to switch or upgrade digital assets with minimal risk.
